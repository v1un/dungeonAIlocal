## Implementation Details

### Cloud API Integration

#### Gemini SDK API

- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Direct integration with Google's official Gemini SDK
  - Support for all available Gemini models (Pro, Ultra)
  - Streaming response handling for real-time text generation
  - Efficient prompt engineering to maximize context usage
  - Error handling and rate limit management

#### OpenRouter API

- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Integration with OpenRouter's unified API
  - Access to multiple model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
  - Model selection interface for users
  - Cost tracking and usage analytics
  - Fallback cascades between models

#### API Management System

- **Features**:
  - Secure API key storage with encryption
  - Usage tracking and quota management
  - Cost estimation before operations
  - Intelligent request batching
  - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
  - Request queuing during connectivity issues
  - Session resumption after interruption

- **Technical Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  interface ApiManager {
    // Model access methods
    sendPrompt(prompt: string, options: RequestOptions): Promise<Response>;
    streamResponse(prompt: string, options: RequestOptions): AsyncIterator<ResponseChunk>;
    
    // Key management
    addApiKey(provider: Provider, key: string): void;
    validateApiKey(provider: Provider, key: string): Promise<ValidationResult>;
    
    // Usage tracking
    getUsageStats(timeframe: Timeframe): UsageStats;
    estimateCost(prompt: string, options: RequestOptions): number;
    
    // Error handling
    retryWithBackoff(request: Request, maxRetries: number): Promise<Response>;
    switchProvider(currentProvider: Provider): Provider;
  }
  ```

### Context Management System

The heart of maintaining coherent adventures:

1. **Hierarchical Context Structure**:
   - Global context (world rules, game state)
   - Local context (current location, present characters)
   - Temporary context (immediate situation)
   - Meta context (system instructions, formatting guidance)

2. **Dynamic Context Window Management**:
   - Optimized prompt construction to minimize token usage
   - Priority-based token allocation:
     - Recent interactions (40%)
     - Character information (20%)
     - Relevant lorebook entries (20%)
     - World state (10%)
     - System instructions (10%)
   - Context compression techniques:
     - Summary generation for older history
     - Key information extraction
     - Entity-focused memory management

3. **State Tracking**:
   - JSON-based state representation
   - Incremental state updates
   - Versioned state history with branching support
   - Conflict resolution for contradictory information

### Franchise-Based Scenario System

Scenarios in DungeonAILocal will be meticulously crafted around specific franchises, series, or IPs selected by the user.

#### User Selection Process

1. User selects from a categorized list of popular media types:
   - Fantasy Series (e.g., Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings)
   - Sci-Fi Universes (e.g., Star Wars, Star Trek)
   - Anime/Manga Worlds (e.g., Naruto, One Piece)
   - Video Game Settings (e.g., Elder Scrolls, Fallout)
   - Comic Book Universes (e.g., Marvel, DC)
   - TV Shows (e.g., Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad)

2. User customizes generation parameters:
   - Time period within the franchise (pre-canon, during events, post-canon)
   - Tone (faithful to original, darker take, comedic version, etc.)
   - Player role (main character, side character, original character)
   - Canon compliance level (strict, loose, alternate universe)

#### Scenario Structure

A comprehensive scenario definition includes:

1. **Core Components**:
   - **Metadata**: Title, franchise, time period, tone, canon level
   - **Introduction**: Player-facing description and setup
   - **System Prompt**: Base instructions for the AI to follow
   - **Initial World State**: Starting conditions and environment
   - **Main NPCs**: Key characters with detailed profiles
   - **Location Map**: Hierarchical representation of game spaces
   - **Quest Structure**: Main and side objectives
   - **Event Triggers**: Conditions that launch specific story events

2. **Scenario Variables**:
   - Player-customizable elements (character name, traits, etc.)
   - Randomization options for replay value
   - Difficulty scaling parameters
   - Alternative paths and endings

#### AI Generation Process

The scenario generator will create ultra-detailed franchise-specific content:

1. **Comprehensive Universe Elements**:
   - **Characters**: Major and minor characters with accurate personalities, abilities, relationships, and dialogue patterns
   - **Locations**: Detailed recreations of canonical locations with appropriate atmospheres and inhabitants
   - **Lore**: Extensive background information drawn directly from the franchise
   - **Magic/Technology Systems**: Accurate implementation of franchise-specific systems (e.g., magic spells from Harry Potter, Force powers from Star Wars)
   - **Factions/Organizations**: All relevant groups with correct motivations and structures
   - **Timeline Events**: Major historical events that shape the world

2. **Generation Methodology**:
   - Specialized system prompts containing franchise-specific knowledge
   - Multi-stage generation process:
     1. Core world establishment based on franchise
     2. Character roster creation with complex relationships
     3. Location mapping with interconnections
     4. Plot hook generation tied to franchise themes
     5. Custom rule implementation for franchise-specific systems
   - Consistency checking against known franchise facts
   - Adaptive adjustment to user's chosen time period and role
